        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" class="a1"
          >markup language</a
        >
        for documents designed to be displayed in a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" class="a1"
          >web browser</a
        >. It defines the content and structure of
        <a href="web content" class="a1"></a>. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as
        <a href="#CSS" class="a1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
        and scripting languages such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" class="a1"
          >JavaScript</a
        >.

          >web server</a
        >
        or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
        originally included cues for its appearance.
        <br />
        HTML can embed programs written in a

          >scripting language</a

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" class="a1"
          >JavaScript</a
        >, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of
        CSS defines the look and layout of content. The

        >
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
        standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
        HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
        video and audio, primarily using the <b>canvas</b> element, together
        with JavaScript.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a

          >style sheet language</a

          class="a2"
          >presentation</a

        and styling of a document written in a markup language such as
        <a href="#HTML">HTML</a> or
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" class="a2">XML</a>
        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        <a href="#JS" class="a2">JavaScript</a>.
        <br />
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
        including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content
        accessibility provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
        reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
        the .css file to be
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)" class="a2"
          >cached</a
        >
        to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
        its formatting

        <a href="#CSS" class="a3">CSS</a>. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the
        client side for webpage behavior.
        <br />
        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client
        code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of
        apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" class="a3">Node.js</a>.
        <br />
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" class="a3"
          >ECMAScrip</a
        >t standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
        and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
        application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
        regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
